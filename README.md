# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project is a **Capstone Project** completed as part of the **Edureka Data Science with SQL** course.  
It showcases a complete movie recommendation system using the **MovieLens dataset**.

---

## 📚 About the Project

The project implements three types of recommendation systems:

1️⃣ **Popularity-Based Recommender**:  
Recommends top-rated movies in a selected genre with a minimum review threshold.

2️⃣ **Content-Based Recommender**:  
Suggests movies similar to a selected one based on genre similarity using **TF-IDF** and **Cosine Similarity**.

3️⃣ **Collaborative Filtering Recommender**:  
Provides personalized movie recommendations based on ratings from similar users.

Interactive inputs and colorful visualizations make it easy to experiment with different genres, movies, and user IDs.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to apply data science techniques to create personalized content discovery systems, similar to platforms like Netflix or Prime Video.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- 🎭 **Genre Distribution**: Visualized as a colorful horizontal bar chart  
- ⭐ **Rating Distribution**: Visualized as a histogram with interactive features  

These plots are generated using **Plotly** and are fully interactive in the notebook.

## 🎯 Recommender Systems Implemented

### 1️⃣ Popularity-Based Recommender
- Input: Genre, Minimum number of reviews, Number of recommendations
- Output: Top-rated movies in the selected genre

### 2️⃣ Content-Based Recommender
- Input: Movie title, Number of similar movies to recommend
- Output: Similar movies based on genre similarity using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity

### 3️⃣ Collaborative Filtering Recommender
- Input: User ID, Number of similar users (K), Number of recommendations
- Output: Personalized movie recommendations based on user similarity

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

1️⃣ Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sravyatogarla/Movie-recommendation-system.git

## 📚 Dataset Description

The data used in this project comes from the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/), a widely used dataset in recommender systems research.

- **movies.csv**: Contains `movieId`, `title`, and `genres`.  
- **ratings.csv**: Contains `userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, and `timestamp`.
